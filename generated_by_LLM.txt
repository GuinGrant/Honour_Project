ICMP ping sweeps are used to detect live hosts on a network. The attacker sends a series of ICMP echo requests to a range of IP addresses, and waits for ICMP echo replies. If an ICMP echo reply is received, the attacker knows that the target IP address is associated with a live host.
Problem Squid is a caching proxy server for HTTP and other applications. It can be used to improve response times by caching documents from the Internet on a local disk. Multiple Squid servers can be used to provide redundancy and increased bandwidth. Squid supports the Web Cache Communication Protocol (WCCP), which allows it to be integrated with Cisco routers. WCCP provides a mechanism for the router to direct HTTP requests to the Squid server. WCCP messages are sent as UDP packets. The message length is not checked, and a malicious attacker can send a large number of bytes in the message. This can cause the Squid server to crash.
